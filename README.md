# lisbon.ai visualizing your models workshop

Some classic concepts and some old concepts all nice, pretty, and visual!

## Structure

In the units directory, there are 6 directories. One for each concept.

Within each of those directories you have an example and an exercise notebook. The way this will work is that we will
present the example notebook to explain the core concepts and then will pass off onto you the
exercise notebook for a quick assignment!

*No worries* if you can't finish today! Take it home and keep going: the idea is that you walk away
from this workshop with an environment that you can keep exploring with.
