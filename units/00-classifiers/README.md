# Classifiers in use today

We'll take a quick look at a few basic classifiers and learn to do some basic visualizations

This is mostly a setup for the rest of the class so that when we start looking at more meaningful
visualizations, you will have a foundation / intuition about what's driving things behind
the scenes.
